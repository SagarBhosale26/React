This is a proof of concept (POC) for code analysis and quality for a React project, you can use a combination of tools and practices that help in identifying and fixing issues before deploying to production.
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed on your local development environment:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or above)

To start the development server and run the application locally, use the following command:
Copy code
npm start"
The app will be available at http://localhost:3000.

Linting
This project uses ESLint for JavaScript, stylelint for CSS, and HTMLHint for HTML linting. Linting helps maintain code quality by enforcing consistent coding styles and catching potential issues.
